## About Me
I am studying computer science at Miami University of Ohio. Although my departure from chemical engineering started less than a year ago, I have made great strides in my understanding of the computing. I am always looking to improve my skillset and aspire to one day make a mark on the world.

## Current work
My immediate research focus is on secure coding using artificial intelligence. In addition to this, I work as a teacher's assistant and am taking several high-level courses, specifically ones related to web design, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.

## Experience
As a professional who pushes to learn about new tools I have worked extensively with a number of frameworks:
- ☕ Java and C++ application development
- 🐍 Python data analysis and machine learning
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, and Javascript frontend web development
- 🐳 Docker, NodeJS, and Typescript backend web development
- 📁 MySQL database management

### About Me
I am currently studying computer science at Miami University of Ohio. Although my past experience had a chemistry focus, I realized after working with artificial intelligence and predictive chemical models that I wanted to pursue a degree in computing. I am currently working on research in secure coding using artificial intelligence.

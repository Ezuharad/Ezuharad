## About Me
I am a graduate studying computer science at Miami University of Ohio with a specialization in neural networks and machine learning.

## Current work
My immediate graduate research focus is in adversarial machine learning and fault detection systems.

## Experience
As a professional who pushes to learn about new tools I have worked extensively with a number of tools:
- 🐍 Python and many of its popular packages, including numpy, pandas, sklearn, and scipy
- 🛠️ Conda, mamba, and pip package managers, jupyter notebooks, and git
- 🔥 PyTorch and Tensorflow deep learning libraries
- 📁 MySQL and Pinecone database management

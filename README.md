About Me
---
I am currently studying computer science at Miami University of Ohio. Although my past experience had a chemistry focus, I realized after working with artificial intelligence and predictive chemical models that I wanted to pursue a degree in computing.

## Current work  
My immediate research focus is on secure coding using artificial intelligence. Additionally, I am trying to learn more about the rust programming language over this winter.

## Experience
As a professional who pushes to learn about new tools I have worked extensively with a number of frameworks, including:
- 💻 Java, Python, and C++
- 🌐 Javascript, NodeJS, and Docker
- 📁 MySQL and PHP
